Welcome to MyLog! This is my very first post.A sentence I really like, I fell in love with it in the summer of 2023. "Remember me with wild grass, the ground is full of it, it never stops." This blog website may not be used to record my life, sorrow for spring and autumn, but it is likely to be used to record some of my learning insights. Starting this sentence, I hope I will persist and never stop!
